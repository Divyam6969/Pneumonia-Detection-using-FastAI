# Pneumonia Detection using FastAI ResNet50 Model
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model from the FastAI library to detect pneumonia in chest X-rays. The dataset used for training the model consists of chest X-rays labeled as normal or pneumonia. The project demonstrates how to fine-tune the pre-trained model using FastAI's.

### Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:
1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Divyam6969/Pneumonia-Detection-using-FastAI-<br>
2) Install the necessary dependencies: pip install fastbook<br>
3) Download the Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle and extract it to the appropriate directory.<br>
Open the pneumonia-detection.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the model.<br>

Note: You will need to have FastAI installed to run this project.
