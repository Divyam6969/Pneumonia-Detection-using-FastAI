# Pneumonia-Detection-using-FastAI-
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model from the FastAI library to detect pneumonia in chest X-rays. The dataset used for training the model consists of chest X-rays labeled as normal or pneumonia. The project demonstrates how to fine-tune the pre-trained model using FastAI's
